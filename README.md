# *Cairn* character sheet for Fari VTT

This is the self-authored origin file for the _[Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com)_ character sheet accepted by the [Fari App](https://fari.app) VTT for inclusion as a site-wide template.

Updates to the sheet will be submitted to the [Fari repo](https://github.com/fariapp/fari-app) in the form of pull requests. I will publish major revisions as releases on this repository in case you prefer a previous version of the sheet.

## Why?

I recently discovered the [Fari App](https://fari.app/) and noticed that a character sheet template did not yet exist for _[Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com)_, the wonderful tabletop adventure game written by [Yochai Gal](https://github.com/yochaigal/) and based on [Ben Milton](https://www.youtube.com/questingbeast)'s _Knave_ and [Chris McDowall](https://www.bastionland.com/)'s _Into The Odd_.

Wanting to introduce a few friends to the game with a _Cairn_ session of my own, I set out to create an accessible, streamlined character sheet that new players could use to familiarize themselves with the game's character creation process, core mechanics, and player principles without having to open and navigate the full SRD.

## Usage

To create a new _Cairn_ character, simply [click here](https://fari.app/characters/new/cairn/cairn). This can also be done by navigating to the **My Binder** > **Characters** menu of the [Fari App](https://fari.app/), selecting **New**, and choosing the "Cairn" template.

Alternatively, download the [latest release](https://github.com/bingus-bonkus/fari-template-cairn/releases/latest) and import the `.fari.json` file through **Characters** menu by selecting **Import** instead of **New**.

## What are the different pages for?

The character sheet is composed of the following pages:

### Character

The first page of the sheet and the only page necessary to manage access and manage your character during play. Contains fields for character details, trackers for HP, Armor, and the Deprived status, important information related to _Cairn_'s "roll under" resolution system, ability score management and embedded save rolling, inventory and currency tracking, and embedded weapon die rolling.

### Magic

A reference page designed to concisely explain the magic system in _Cairn_. This page is split into two columns: one describing the forms of magic present in the game; one describing the procedure for using spells during play.

### Rules Summary

A reference page containing the full text of the SRD section of the same name. This page contains an embedded link to the full [_Cairn_ SRD](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/) and includes minor changes to the source text for improved readability.

### Player Principles

A reference page containing the full text of the SRD section of the same name. In practice, I suggest that the Warden reads over this page with players _after_ character creation but _before_ play begins.

## Disclaimers

First, it's important to note while this character sheet is perfectly usable and feature complete at this point in time, I already have plans to populate the template with additional helper text to make the character creation process easier for first-time players to understand.

Additionally, this character sheet has not been playtested beyond the creation of a few test characters in an [offline Fari session](https://fari.app/play-offline) to glean minor insights into the new-user process.
